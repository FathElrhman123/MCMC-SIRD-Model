# MCMC-SIRD-Model
Parameter Estimation &amp; Case Prediction of a SIRD Model using the Metropolis Hasting MCMC algorithm. 

## Jupyter Notebook
The jupyter notebook has everything needed to estimate parameters and predict future cases. The priors, case data, and ground truths can be found in the following csv files 
- case_data.csv : Infection data from day 0-50 for a small town in India
- prior_data_worldwide.csv : known parameter values for different cities throughout the world
- test_predictions.csv : observed data for I, R, D for days 51-110 in the same town
